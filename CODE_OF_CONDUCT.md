# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members of the group and contributors pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy environment.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
group include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  group

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

**All** group members are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Group members have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all group spaces (eg. 3rd party communication channels), and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the group in at university and in other public spaces.
Examples of representing our group include presenting, attending lectures, or acting as an appointed representative when talking to others.
Outside of these scenarios, anything may be deemed 'representing' by the group members, and if brought to the attention of the group, will result in enforcement being applied.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to group members responsible for enforcement at [softeng310group7@gmail.com](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox?compose=GTvVlcSDbhDtHkcglzPlSkQPbjKvpHgGKKKrHSMVnGrLPcptXFXRzSNbfTRwZMPmBKFQtpxBtzwpg), or privately to a group member or course co-ordinator.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All parties involved are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:
