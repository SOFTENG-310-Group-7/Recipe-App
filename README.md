# MealMatch app
## About the project

Our project aims to tackle one of the world's greatest mysteries. What's for dinner tonight? A question that has stumped us all at one point or another. However, with the use of Artificial Intelligence and the abundance of recipes online, we have an idea for a solution, MealMatch. A mobile web-app which allows you to input the ingredients you have in your pantry, receiving back a detailed recipe outlining a meal best suited to you and your kitchen. With the ability to save recipes, youâ€™ll be able to hold on to your favourite recipes and even plan out your recipes and groceries for the whole week. Print out a shopping list, share your favourite recipes, search for a related recipe, MealMatch will cover all your culinary needs in one space.


## Getting started

To correctly set up the application for viewing/contributions, follow the steps below.

1. Make a fork of the repository.
2. Clone the repository into your local machine.
3. Optionally, run the command `git remote add upstream https://github.com/SOFTENG-310-Group-7/Recipe-App/` to push and pull changes to/from the main repository. Keep in mind that all changes must be approved via a code review and pull request, as seen in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) - *'How to Submit a Pull Request'*.

From here, the easiest way to deploy the app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Please refer to [/frontend/README.md](/frontend/README.md) for further details on deploying the app.

# Built with

## Tech stack

**Frontend** - The front end was developed using a React and Next.js framework for the user interface.

**Backend** - Node.js with Express is used for backend logic such as authentication, storing user
data, and integrating with external APIs.

**Database** - MongoDB is used to store user and recipe data.

**Auth** - Auth0 is used for creating accounts.

**APIs** - Gemini API is used for retrieving AI generated recipes and Pexels API is used for generating images.
